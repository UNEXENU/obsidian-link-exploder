# Overview

Link Exploder is a plugin that converts the current note into a [canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas). It embeds linked notes (and the linked notes linked notes) in the canvas. Useful to converting those MoCs (Map of Contents) into a visual map or visually exploring topics and how they interact with each other.
