# Overview

ðŸ”—ðŸ’£

Link Exploder is a Obsidian plugin that converts the current note into a [canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas), embeding it's linked notes (and their linked notes). Useful to converting those MoCs (Map of Contents) into a visual map or visually exploring topics and how they interact with each other.

Not avalable on the store yet, so you will need to use [obsidian42-brat](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat)

## Usage

After installation navigate to a page you would like to create a canvas version of and then use the "Create Canvas From File Links" action from the command palette 

## Notes

- this is a first release so very basic at the moment
- Love to hear feedback on features to make this better.
